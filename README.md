# ConsenSys-Application
Joey Deeds' application for ConsenSys

## log of timeline
New to blockchain. Step 1 was to review the code after cloning it. 
Initial thoughts, drizzle is essentially redux for etherium. 
Struggled for an hour to get the ABI json. Realized its on the ethscan site in the code tab.
Inititally I was trying to fetch it using the api documentationt, which I got working but ending up just copying and pasting later on.
Now to mess with the drizzle object and get something to display.
